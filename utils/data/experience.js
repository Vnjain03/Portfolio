    description: "I worked on a project called One Click, which is a real-time platform designed to connect startups with potential investors. My role involved developing the entire frontend using React, where I focused on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless interactions between users. One of the key features I implemented was real-time chat functionality using Socket.io, allowing startups and investors to communicate instantly and engage in discussions about investment opportunities. Additionally, I integrated various APIs to enhance the platformâ€™s capabilities, such as user authentication and data management, which provided a more robust experience for users. I also designed intuitive admin dashboards that enable administrators to effectively manage user interactions, monitor message history, and gain insights into platform activity. Throughout the development process, I prioritized responsive design, ensuring that the application remains accessible and functional across all devices. My contributions helped create an effective environment that fosters collaboration and connections between startups and investors."
